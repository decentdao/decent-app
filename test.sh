# A script to facilitate booting Docker and the Decent containers if they are not already running before running Playwright tests.
# Usage:
#   `source test.sh` - to run all Playwright tests, for all browsers
#   `source test.sh tests/{path to test}` - to run a specific test, for all browsers
#
# Please follow setup instructions in README.md under "Testing - Playwright" prior to using this script.

# Step 1: Open Docker, only if it is not already running
if (! docker stats --no-stream &>/dev/null )
then
  open -gja Docker &>/dev/null; # open Mac OS Docker app
  echo "Waiting for Docker to start...";
  while (! docker stats --no-stream &>/dev/null) # keep checking until it's fully started
  do
    sleep 5;
  done
  echo "Docker is running!";

# Step 2: if the Decent containers aren't running, start those as well

# Step 3: run tests, either with the given file, or all of them if the parameter is empty
